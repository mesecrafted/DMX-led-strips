# DMX512 controlled LED strips

This project makes custom addressable led strip fixtures controllable with DMX512. We used inexpensive parts to build a decent quality addressable LED fixture. 

## The hardware we used

These parts can be subbed out for compatible replacements.

## Downloading and compiling the code 

The software can be compiled and installed on a ESP32 with the PlatformIO vscode extension. This repo includes a `platformio.ini` file, so PlatformIO should automatically download the libraries you need. 

Before compiling the code make sure to check the constants set near the top of `src/main.cpp`.
